Hi! I am Suyi.

Originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I spent 8 years living in Shanghai, China, before moving to the United States for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. I am currently a PhD student in Social Psychology. My research focuses on the role of culture in shaping individuals' emotions, motivation, and decision-making in relation to the use of technology.

As a "third culture kid", I truly believe that people from different cultures share a lot of similarities, but also have their unique tendencies and needs. I also believe that technology is a powerful and efficient tool that can address many social problems (e.g., using digital instead of traditional contact tracing for COVID-19). However, in an increasingly diverse and connected world, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. I aspire to use my knowledge and experience to explore interpersonal and environmental factors that shape people's use of technology.

Outside research, I love taking long walks, meeting new (and old) friends, and trying out different sports and workout programs. Recently, I grew fond of tennis but am having a hard time correcting my badminton posture to return the ball in a rally!
